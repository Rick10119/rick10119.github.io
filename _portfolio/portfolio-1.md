## Project Overview

This project involved designing an optimized operation strategy for an auto manufacturing plant in Chongqing, integrating:
- 60MW industrial load (manufacturing facilities)
- 60MW/240MWh energy storage system
- 10MW solar generation capacity

The implementation was a collaboration between the manufacturing plant and State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), focused on leveraging digital technology to optimize energy usage patterns.

## Results and Impact

The implemented project is generating approximately $4 million in annual savings. This substantial economic benefit demonstrates the significant value that can be created through intelligent energy management of industrial loads and distributed energy resources.
