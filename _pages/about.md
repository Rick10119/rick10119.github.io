I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University, working with Prof. Bolun Xu. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Chongqing Kang. Before joining Columbia, I held research appointments at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Princeton University’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment.

My research examines how energy infrastructure and the systems it serves can be co-designed to enable a reliable and affordable transition to clean energy. Grounded in power systems, optimization, and electricity markets, I focus particularly on the interaction between electricity infrastructure and flexible industrial demand. I combine macro-energy systems optimization, engineering models of industrial processes, and empirical analysis of smart-meter data to develop physically grounded, scalable representations of demand flexibility and assess its value to energy-system planning and operations.

## Research Vision

My broader vision is to build a **demand flexibility economy** in which large energy users adapt their operations and investments to renewable electricity availability while earning predictable returns for the flexibility they provide.
